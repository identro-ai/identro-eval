3. **Analysis** - Extracts agent contracts and capabilities
4. **Test Generation** - Uses LLM to create intelligent tests
5. **Execution** - Runs tests with real-time monitoring

> **Note**: You'll need an OpenAI API key (currently the only supported LLM provider).

### The .identro Folder

Identro creates a `.identro/` folder in your project with everything organized:

```
.identro/
├── agents/              # One YAML file per agent (contracts, metadata)
├── teams/               # One YAML file per team (structure, workflows)
├── tests/               # Test specifications organized by entity/dimension
├── dimensions/          # Dimension definitions (what to test and how)
├── reports/             # Generated test reports and dashboards
├── history/             # Version snapshots and backups
├── eval-spec.json       # Complete evaluation spec (source of truth)
├── eval.config.yml      # Your project configuration
└── README.md            # Folder structure documentation
```

**Human-readable YAML files** make it easy to:
- Browse your agents and their capabilities
- Understand team structures and workflows
- Review test specifications by dimension
- Track changes over time with version history

## 🔐 How Identro Works with Your Environment

**Privacy-first, zero-config design** - Identro automatically detects and uses your existing Python environments and LLM configurations without requiring any setup.

### Python Environment Detection

Identro intelligently finds the correct Python interpreter for each project:

#### **Detection Priority (Automatic)**
1. **Virtual Environments** (Highest Priority)
   - Checks: `venv/`, `.venv/`, `env/`, `.env/`
   - If found → Uses venv Python (isolated dependencies)

2. **Poetry Environments**
   - Runs: `poetry env info -p`
   - Uses Poetry-managed Python if available

3. **System Python** (Fallback)
   - Searches `PATH` directories for `python3`
   - **Validates each Python has `crewai` installed**
   - Uses first Python that passes validation

#### **Performance Optimization**
- **First run**: Searches for Python (~2-3 seconds if no venv)
- **Cached run**: Instant (~0.1 seconds) ⚡
- **Cache location**: `.identro/.python-cache.json`
- **Auto-validation**: Cache invalidated if Python changes

#### **Why This Matters**
✅ Works with any Python setup (venv, Poetry, system)  
✅ No configuration required  
✅ Respects project-specific environments  
✅ Fast startup after first run  
✅ Validates dependencies are available  

### LLM Configuration Auto-Detection

Identro automatically discovers your LLM API keys:

#### **Supported Providers**
- **OpenAI** - Looks for `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` or environment

> **⚠️ Important Note**: Currently, Identro-Eval **only supports OpenAI models** for LLM evaluation calls. Support for Anthropic and other providers is coming soon.

#### **Zero Configuration**
```bash
# Just set your API key in .env
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-..." >> .env

# Identro finds it automatically
npx identro-eval interactive
```

#### **Privacy Guarantee**
- 🔒 All execution happens **locally** in your environment
- 🔒 API keys are **read from your .env**, never transmitted elsewhere
- 🔒 Agent execution uses **your LLM accounts**, not Identro's
- 🔒 Test results stored **only on your machine**
- 🔒 No data sent to Identro servers (there are no Identro servers!)

### What Identro Never Does

❌ **Never** collects your API keys  
❌ **Never** transmits your test data  
❌ **Never** requires signup or account  
❌ **Never** sends data to external services  
❌ **Never** modifies your agent code  

### Example: Multi-Project Setup

```bash
# Project 1: Uses Poetry environment
cd project-a
npx identro-eval interactive  # Finds Poetry venv automatically

# Project 2: Uses system Python
cd project-b
npx identro-eval interactive  # Uses system Python with crewai

# Project 3: Uses venv
cd project-c
npx identro-eval interactive  # Finds ./venv/bin/python
```

Each project gets its **own cached Python path** - no cross-contamination!

## 📋 Contract Generation & Analysis

Identro automatically analyzes your AI agents and teams to extract their **contracts** - comprehensive specifications of what they do, how they work, and their operational boundaries.

### What is a Contract?

A contract is a structured specification that includes:

**For Agents:**
- **Role**: What the agent does (e.g., "Senior Research Analyst")
- **Goal**: Primary objective (e.g., "Uncover cutting-edge AI developments")
- **Backstory**: Context and expertise
- **Tools**: Available tools (search, file operations, APIs)
- **Capabilities**: Inferred abilities (web_search, data_analysis)
- **Boundaries**: What the agent can and cannot do

**For Teams:**
- **Description**: What the team accomplishes as a whole
- **Goal**: End-to-end outcome the team achieves
- **Capabilities**: Team-level capabilities from combined agents
- **Member Structure**: Agents, tasks, and workflow
- **Process Type**: Sequential, hierarchical, or parallel execution
- **Boundaries**: Aggregated allowed/forbidden actions from all members

### How Contracts Are Generated

#### Agent Contracts (YAML-based Agents)
```yaml
# agents.yaml
research_agent:
  role: Senior Research Analyst
  goal: Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI
  tools: [search_tool, web_tool]
```

Identro extracts this directly from your YAML configuration - **no LLM call needed**. The contract is generated instantly from your agent definition.

#### Agent Contracts (Python-based Agents)
```python
# agents.py
Agent(
    role='Senior Research Analyst',
    goal='Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI',
    tools=[search_tool, web_tool]
)
```

Identro uses an **LLM to analyze** your Python code and extract the contract, including implicit capabilities and patterns.

#### Team Contracts (LLM-Powered Analysis)
Identro analyzes the team's complete structure and uses an LLM to generate detailed contracts:

**Input to LLM:**
- All member agents (roles, goals, tools)
- All tasks (descriptions, expected outputs)
- Workflow structure and dependencies
- Team process type (sequential/hierarchical)

**LLM Generates:**
- Specific description of what the team does
- End-to-end goal the team achieves
- Team-level capabilities inferred from members

**Example Output:**
```yaml
description: >-
  The research_crew team is a specialized group of AI agents focused on conducting in-depth
  research, analysis, and documentation of advancements in AI frameworks and evaluation systems.
  The team operates sequentially, with each agent playing a critical role in transforming raw data
  into actionable intelligence.
  
goal: >-
  To deliver a comprehensive executive report summarizing the latest developments, trends, and
  evaluations in AI agent frameworks, providing stakeholders with actionable insights and
  strategic recommendations.
```

### Where Contracts Are Stored

Contracts are stored in multiple places for easy access:

1. **`.identro/eval-spec.json`** - Master database (machine-readable)
2. **`.identro/agents/*.yml`** - Per-agent YAML files (human-readable)
3. **`.identro/teams/*.yml`** - Per-team YAML files (human-readable)

Example agent contract file:
```yaml
# .identro/agents/research_agent.yml
name: research_agent
type: yaml
description: Senior Research Analyst
contract:
  role: Senior Research Analyst
  goal: Uncover cutting-edge developments in AI and technology
  backstory: Expert researcher with 15 years of experience...
  tools: [search_tool, web_tool]
  capabilities:
    - web_search
    - information_retrieval
    - research
    - analysis
```

## 🛡️ Action Boundaries

Action boundaries define what your AI agents **can** and **cannot** do. Identro automatically extracts these boundaries by analyzing agent configurations, tools, and behavioral constraints.

### What Are Boundaries?

Boundaries are **explicit rules** about agent behavior, categorized into:

- **Allowed Actions**: Things the agent is permitted to do
- **Forbidden Actions**: Things the agent must not do
- **Numeric Limits**: Quantitative constraints (e.g., max iterations)

### Boundary Categories

Each boundary is categorized for easy understanding:

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `tool_usage` | Tool permissions | "Use search_tool for web research" |
| `data_access` | Data permissions | "Read customer data" |
| `external_service` | API/service access | "Call OpenAI API for generation" |
| `business_rule` | Business constraints | "Process refunds up to $500" |
| `operational_constraint` | Workflow limits | "Maximum 25 iterations per task" |
| `safety_policy` | Safety rules | "Never execute system commands" |
| `professional_activity` | Domain activities | "Conduct research and analysis" |

### How Boundaries Are Extracted

Identro uses **LLM analysis** to extract boundaries from your agent configurations:

**For YAML Agents:**
```yaml
# agents.yaml
research_agent:
  role: Senior Research Analyst
  tools: [search_tool]
  max_iter: 25
  allow_delegation: false
```

**LLM Analyzes:**
1. **Agent Definition** (role, goal, backstory) → professional activities
2. **Tool List** → allowed tool usage actions
3. **Behavioral Config** (max_iter, allow_delegation) → numeric limits and constraints

**Extracted Boundaries:**
```yaml
boundaries:
  allowed_actions:
    - action: "Conduct research and analysis on AI developments"
      confidence: 0.98
      category: professional_activity
      sources:
        - type: llm_inference
          evidence: "Agent role states 'Senior Research Analyst'"
          
    - action: "Use search_tool for information retrieval"
      confidence: 0.98
      category: tool_usage
      sources:
        - type: yaml_tools
          evidence: "Tool 'search_tool' in agent tools list"
          
  forbidden_actions:
    - action: "Delegate tasks or responsibilities"
      confidence: 1.0
      category: operational_constraint
      sources:
        - type: yaml_behavior_config
          evidence: "allow_delegation: false"
          
  numeric_limits:
    - parameter: "max_iterations"
      value: 25
      operator: "<="
      description: "Maximum iterations per task"
```

### Boundary Confidence Scores

Each boundary has a **confidence score** (0.0-1.0) based on:
- **1.0**: Explicit in configuration (e.g., `allow_delegation: false`)
- **0.9-0.98**: Clear from role/goal/tools
- **0.7-0.89**: Inferred from context
- **<0.7**: Speculative (flagged for review)

### Team Boundaries (Aggregated)

Team boundaries are **aggregated** from all member agents with attribution:

```yaml
# .identro/teams/research_crew.yml
boundaries:
  allowed_actions:
    - action: "Use search_tool for information retrieval"
      agent: research_agent           # Unique to one agent
      confidence: 0.98
      
    - action: "Process and analyze data"
      agents: [research_agent, analysis_agent]  # Shared by multiple
      confidence: 0.95
      
  forbidden_actions:
    - action: "Delegate tasks"
      agents: [research_agent, analysis_agent, writer_agent]  # All agents
      confidence: 1.0
```

### Viewing Boundaries

**In Dashboards:**
```bash
# Open agents dashboard to see boundaries
npx identro-eval agents dashboard

# Open teams dashboard to see aggregated boundaries
npx identro-eval teams dashboard
```

**Agents Dashboard** shows:
- Allowed actions (green cards) with confidence scores
- Forbidden actions (red cards) with confidence scores
- Categories and numeric limits
- "View Sources" button to see evidence and locations

**Teams Dashboard** shows:
- Aggregated boundaries from all members
- Agent attribution (which agents share each boundary)
- Visual distinction between single-agent and shared boundaries

**In YAML Files:**
```bash
# View agent boundaries
cat .identro/agents/research_agent.yml

# View team boundaries  
cat .identro/teams/research_crew.yml
```

### Conditional Constraints

Identro supports **conditional boundaries** for rules that depend on context or values:

**Simple Numeric Limits:**
```yaml
forbidden_actions:
  - action: "Process refunds exceeding $500"
    type: forbidden
    numericLimit:
      parameter: "refund_amount"
      value: 500
      operator: ">"
      unit: "USD"
```

**Complex Conditions:**
```yaml
forbidden_actions:
  - action: "Process refunds"
    type: forbidden
    conditions:
      - description: "After 30 days from purchase date"
        parameter: "days_since_purchase"
        operator: ">"
        value: 30
        unit: "days"
```

**Where Conditionals Are Extracted:**
- **YAML Config**: `max_iter: 25`, `allow_delegation: false`
- **Python Code**: `if days_since_purchase > 30: raise ValueError(...)`
- **Tool Implementations**: Guard clauses and validation logic
- **Agent Descriptions**: LLM infers constraints from role/goal

**Example - Refund Agent:**
```yaml
# agents.yaml
refund_agent:
  role: Customer Service Refund Processor
  backstory: You handle refunds within the 30-day policy window
  max_refund_amount: 500
```

**Extracted Boundaries:**
```yaml
boundaries:
  forbidden_actions:
    - action: "Approve refunds exceeding $500"
      numericLimit:
        parameter: "refund_amount"
        value: 500
        operator: ">"
        unit: "USD"
    - action: "Process refunds after 30-day window"
      conditions:
        - parameter: "days_since_purchase"
          operator: ">"
          value: 30
          unit: "days"
```

### Configuration

Control boundary extraction in `.identro/eval.config.yml`:

```yaml
boundary_extraction:
  enabled: true              # Enable/disable boundary extraction
  privacy_mode: false        # Use LLM (false) or static-only (true)
  confidence_threshold: 0.5  # Minimum confidence to include
```

**Privacy Mode:**
- `false` (default): Uses LLM to infer boundaries (more comprehensive)
- `true`: Static analysis only (no LLM calls, basic boundaries)

### Why Boundaries Matter

Boundaries help you:
- ✅ **Understand Capabilities**: Know what your agents can do
- ✅ **Identify Risks**: See potential security or compliance issues
- ✅ **Document Behavior**: Clear specification of agent limitations
- ✅ **Test Comprehensively**: Generate tests that respect boundaries
- ✅ **Validate Changes**: Track when boundaries evolve

## 🎯 How It Works

Identro uses a **5-step intelligent evaluation process** that goes far beyond simple string matching:

```
📁 Step 1: Discovery & Framework Detection
├─ Scans your project directory recursively
├─ Detects AI framework (CrewAI, LangChain, etc.)
├─ Finds agent definitions (agents.py, agents.yaml)
├─ Discovers team/crew configurations
├─ Creates .identro/eval.config.yml if not exists
└─ Initializes dimension files in .identro/dimensions/

🔑 Step 2: LLM Configuration
├─ Scans for API keys in environment (.env, env vars)
├─ Auto-detects available providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
├─ Lets you select which LLM to use for test generation
└─ Configures concurrency limits for API calls

📋 Step 3: Contract Analysis & eval-spec.json
├─ Extracts agent contracts (role, goal, tools, backstory)
├─ Analyzes team structures and workflows
├─ Creates/updates .identro/eval-spec.json
├─ This file becomes the source of truth for:
│  ├─ Agent metadata and capabilities
│  ├─ Test specifications per dimension
│  └─ Evaluation criteria for each test
└─ Users can manually edit this file to customize tests

🧠 Step 4: Intelligent Test Generation
├─ For each agent × dimension combination:
│  ├─ Reads dimension definition from .identro/dimensions/
│  ├─ Sends agent contract + dimension prompt to LLM
│  ├─ LLM generates test inputs and evaluation criteria
│  └─ Stores in eval-spec.json
├─ Multi-run tests get multiple variations
└─ Concurrent LLM calls with queue management

🚀 Step 5: Test Execution & Evaluation
├─ Loads tests from eval-spec.json
├─ For each test:
│  ├─ Executes agent/team with test input
│  ├─ Captures output and performance metrics
│  ├─ Sends output + criteria to LLM for evaluation
│  └─ LLM judges if test passed based on criteria
├─ Real-time Test Monitor:
│  ├─ Progress Panel: Test queue and completion status
│  └─ Execution Log: Live output from agent execution
└─ Aggregates results for multi-run consistency

📊 Step 6: Report Generation
├─ Generates interactive HTML dashboard
├─ Shows test results by agent and dimension
├─ Includes LLM evaluation feedback
└─ Saves to .identro/reports/
```


## 🧩 Understanding Dimensions

**Dimensions are the core innovation of Identro.** They define WHAT to test and HOW to evaluate AI agents.

### What is a Dimension?

A dimension is a TypeScript definition that instructs Identro to:
1. Generate specific types of test inputs
2. Define evaluation criteria
3. Configure test behavior (multi-run, thresholds, etc.)
4. **NEW:** Provide business context to LLMs for better test generation

### 🆕 Enhanced Dimension Context (v2.0)

Dimensions now include optional **business context** that enriches LLM understanding:

```typescript
{
  context: {
    why_it_matters: `
      Business & user impact explanation
      Real-world consequences of failures
      Critical domains where this matters
    `,
    when_to_prioritize: `
      HIGH PRIORITY: Critical use cases
      MEDIUM PRIORITY: Important scenarios  
      LOWER PRIORITY: Nice-to-have cases
    `
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Better Test Generation**: LLMs generate more relevant, domain-appropriate tests
- **Priority Awareness**: LLMs understand when dimensions are critical vs nice-to-have
- **Real-World Grounding**: Tests reflect actual business impacts and failure scenarios
- **Flexible**: Dimensions can add custom context fields for specific needs

All 12 dimensions now include this enriched context, leading to significantly better test quality.

### Dimension Structure

```yaml
# .identro/dimensions/consistency.yml
name: consistency

prompts:
  # This prompt is sent to the LLM to generate test inputs
  test_generation: |
    Generate test inputs that verify the agent produces
    consistent outputs when given the same input multiple times.
    Focus on testing reliability and repeatability of responses.
    
  # This prompt helps LLM evaluate the results
  evaluation_criteria: |
    Check if the outputs are semantically similar.
    Minor variations in wording are acceptable.
    Core information must remain consistent.

### Available Dimensions (12 Total)

Identro provides 12 evaluation dimensions organized into three categories:

#### **🔵 Core Dimensions** (3) - Enabled by Default
Essential dimensions for all AI agents:

| Dimension | Icon | Purpose | Key Tests |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| **Consistency** | 🔄 | Response reliability | Multi-run stability, output variance, behavioral predictability |
| **Safety** | 🛡️ | Security & prompt injection | Boundary violations, adversarial inputs, system prompt protection |
| **Performance** | ⚡ | Response time & efficiency | Latency measurement, throughput testing, timeout handling |

#### **🟢 Quality Dimensions** (5) - Enabled by Default
Advanced quality assurance dimensions:

| Dimension | Icon | Purpose | Key Tests |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| **Completeness** | ✓ | All required elements present | Missing information, data points, structural integrity |
| **Accuracy** | 🎯 | Factual correctness | Fact validation, calculation precision, data integrity |
| **Relevance** | 🔍 | Addresses user request | Input alignment, scope appropriateness, topic adherence |
| **Format** | 📋 | Correct structure | Schema compliance, data format, structural validation |
| **Instruction Following** | 📝 | Adheres to constraints | Rule compliance, boundary respect, constraint adherence |

#### **🟡 Enterprise Dimensions** (4) - Opt-in (Disabled by Default)
Specialized dimensions for business requirements:

| Dimension | Icon | Purpose | Key Tests |
|---------|------|---------|-----------|
| **Compliance** | ⚖️ | Regulatory requirements | GDPR/HIPAA/SOX compliance, audit trails, legal requirements |
| **Brand Voice** | 🎨 | Brand consistency | Tone maintenance, messaging alignment, style guide adherence |

| **Privacy** | 🔒 | PII protection | Sensitive data handling, data minimization, redaction |

📚 **[See detailed dimension documentation →](packages/core/src/dimensions/README.md)**

### Dimension Selection Guide

**Start with Core dimensions** (consistency, safety, performance) for all agents.

**Add Quality dimensions** based on your agent's purpose:
- Information retrieval → completeness, accuracy
- Conversational → relevance, instruction-following
- Structured output → format

**Enable Enterprise dimensions** only when needed:
- compliance → Regulated industries
- brand-voice → Customer-facing agents
- bias-fairness → Decision-making systems
- privacy → Handling sensitive data

### How Dimensions Work

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Dimension YAML] --> B[LLM Test Generation]
    B --> C[Test Inputs Created]
    C --> D[Agent Execution]
    D --> E[LLM Evaluation]
    E --> F[Pass/Fail Result]
```

1. **Test Generation Phase**: LLM reads the dimension prompt + agent contract → generates test inputs
2. **Execution Phase**: Each test input is run against the agent (multiple times for consistency)
3. **Evaluation Phase**: LLM evaluates outputs against the dimension's criteria

### Customizing Dimensions

Create domain-specific dimensions for your use case:

```bash
# Create new dimension
npx identro-eval dimensions create financial-accuracy

              "priority": 1
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🧠 Criterion-Level Semantic Evaluation

Identro uses **criterion-level semantic evaluation** where the LLM evaluates each test criterion independently with detailed evidence. This provides actionable insights and eliminates hardcoded thresholds.

### NEW: Structured Evaluation Criteria

Each test now uses structured criteria objects with optional customization:

```json
{
  "evaluation_criteria": [
    {
      "criterion": "Output maintains consistent structure across all runs",
      "evaluation_strictness": 85,
      "special_instructions": "Focus on semantic similarity, not exact wording"
    },
    {
      "criterion": "All cited data sources are validated and accurate"
    }
  ],
  "thresholds": {
    "passing_criteria_percentage": 100
  }
}
```

### How Criterion-Level Evaluation Works

Unlike traditional testing that uses exact string matching, Identro uses **LLM-based semantic evaluation** to understand the meaning and quality of agent responses.

### How It Works

### Why Semantic Evaluation?

**Traditional Testing Problems:**
- String matching fails with AI outputs
- Exact comparisons don't work with creative responses
- Can't evaluate quality, only exact matches
- Brittle tests that break with minor changes

**LLM Evaluation Advantages:**
- Understands meaning, not just text
- Evaluates quality and correctness
- Handles variations in expression
- Provides detailed feedback on failures

### Evaluation Process

1. **Agent Execution**: Your agent processes the test input
2. **Output Capture**: The agent's response is captured with metadata
3. **Criteria Application**: Evaluation criteria from the dimension are loaded
4. **LLM Judgment**: The output + criteria are sent to the LLM evaluator
5. **Semantic Analysis**: LLM determines if the output meets the criteria
6. **Result Recording**: Pass/fail result with detailed reasoning

### Example Criterion-Level Evaluation

```json
{
  "testInput": "Explain the benefits of renewable energy",
  "agentOutput": "Renewable energy sources like solar...",
  "evaluation_criteria": [
    {"criterion": "Mentions environmental benefits"},
    {"criterion": "Discusses economic advantages"},
    {"criterion": "Factually accurate information"}
  ],
  "llmEvaluation": {
    "passed": true,
    "score": 0.95,
    "reasoning": {
      "criterionAnalysis": [
        {
          "criterion": "Mentions environmental benefits",
          "met": true,
          "score": 1.0,
          "evidence": "The response mentions 'reducing greenhouse gas emissions' which directly addresses environmental benefits.",
          "reasoning": "Clearly meets the criterion with specific environmental benefit cited."
        },
        {
          "criterion": "Discusses economic advantages",
          "met": true,
          "score": 0.9,
          "evidence": "Response includes 'job creation and energy independence' as economic benefits.",
          "reasoning": "Economic advantages are well-covered with concrete examples."
        },
        {
          "criterion": "Factually accurate information",
          "met": true,
          "score": 0.95,
          "evidence": "All statements are verifiable: emissions reduction, job creation, and cost-effectiveness trends are accurate.",
          "reasoning": "Information provided is factually correct and well-supported."
        }
      ],
      "overallAssessment": "3/3 criteria passed (100% >= 100% threshold)"
    }

## 🌐 API Server

Identro includes a **local API server** that enables interactive GUI features like the Dimensions Dashboard. The server runs locally on your machine and provides zero-friction editing capabilities.

### Purpose

The API server bridges the gap between browser-based GUIs and file system operations:
- **Browser Security**: Browsers cannot directly write to files for security reasons
- **Local Solution**: API server runs locally, providing secure file access
- **Zero Friction**: Click and save—no downloads, no prompts
- **Reusable**: Can be used for future interactive features

### Configuration

Configure the API server port in `.identro/eval.config.yml`:

```yaml
# .identro/eval.config.yml
api_server:
  port: 3456  # Default port (customizable)
```

### Endpoints

The API server provides RESTful endpoints for file operations:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/health` | GET | Health check and server status |
| `/api/dimensions/toggle` | POST | Enable/disable dimension instantly |
| `/api/dimensions/save` | POST | Save dimension YAML edits instantly |

### Security

**All operations are local and secure:**
- ✅ Runs on `localhost` only (not accessible from network)
- ✅ No authentication needed (local access only)
- ✅ No data transmission to external services
- ✅ Direct file access using your system permissions
- ✅ Server stops when you press Ctrl+C

### Usage

The server starts automatically with interactive features:

```bash
# Start dimensions dashboard (launches server automatically)
npx identro-eval dimensions dashboard

# Server starts at configured port (default: 3456)
# Dashboard opens in browser
# Server runs until you press Ctrl+C
```

**Server Lifecycle:**
1. CLI command triggers server start
2. Server finds available port (starting with configured port)
3. Dashboard/GUI opens in browser
4. User interacts with GUI
5. GUI sends API requests to server
6. Server saves changes to files
7. Press Ctrl+C to stop server gracefully

### Port Configuration

If the default port is in use, you can change it:

```yaml
# .identro/eval.config.yml
api_server:
  port: 8080  # Use any available port
```

Or the server will automatically find the next available port if the configured port is busy.

### Future Use Cases

The API server infrastructure supports future interactive features:
- 📊 **Live Test Monitoring**: Real-time test execution dashboards
- 📝 **Report Editor**: Interactive report customization
- 🎯 **Agent Configuration**: GUI for agent settings
- 📈 **Analytics Dashboard**: Visual metrics and insights
- 🔍 **Debug Interface**: Interactive debugging tools

### Troubleshooting

**Port Already in Use:**
- Change port in config file
- Server will auto-find next available port
- Check with: `lsof -i :3456` (macOS/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :3456` (Windows)

**Server Won't Start:**
- Check firewall settings (allow localhost connections)
- Ensure Node.js has necessary permissions
- Try different port in config

**Connection Issues:**
- Verify server is running (check terminal output)
- Dashboard URL matches server port
- Browser allows localhost connections

## 📦 Version Management & History

Identro automatically tracks changes to your evaluation setup with built-in version management and snapshot capabilities.

### Automatic Snapshots

Every time you analyze agents or generate tests, Identro creates a version snapshot:

```
.identro/history/
├── snapshots/
│   ├── 2025-10-23T14-30-15/    # Timestamped snapshot
│   │   ├── agents/              # Agent YAML files at this version
│   │   ├── teams/               # Team YAML files at this version
│   │   ├── tests/               # Test YAML files at this version
│   │   └── manifest.yml         # What changed in this version
│   └── 2025-10-23T09-22-03/    # Previous snapshot
├── manifest.yml                 # Complete version history
└── eval-spec-*.json            # Eval spec backups
```

### What Gets Tracked

- **Agent contracts** - Role, goal, capabilities changes
- **Team structures** - Member changes, workflow updates
- **Test specifications** - New tests, modified criteria
- **Configuration changes** - Dimension settings, thresholds

### Version Manifest

The manifest tracks detailed change information:

```yaml
# .identro/history/manifest.yml
current_version: "2025-10-23T14-30-15"
versions:
  - version_id: "2025-10-23T14-30-15"
    timestamp: "2025-10-23T14:30:15.123Z"
    trigger: "test_generation"
    changes:
      agents:
        - name: research_agent
          change_type: modified
          source_hash: abc123...
      teams:
        - name: research_crew
          change_type: unmodified
      tests:
        - entity: research_agent
          dimension: consistency
          change_type: added
          test_count: 3
    dependencies:
      agent_versions:
        research_agent: 2
      team_versions:
        research_crew: 1
```

### Retention Policy

Configure how long snapshots are kept:

```yaml
# .identro/eval.config.yml
versioning:
  enabled: true
  snapshots:
    max_count: 20           # Keep last 20 snapshots
    max_age_days: 30        # Delete older than 30 days
    always_keep_latest: 5   # Always preserve 5 most recent
```

### Benefits

✅ **Audit Trail** - See exactly what changed and when  
✅ **Rollback Capability** - Restore previous configurations  
✅ **Change Detection** - Only regenerate what actually changed  
✅ **Git-Friendly** - YAML snapshots are easy to review in diffs  
✅ **Automatic Cleanup** - Old snapshots cleaned up automatically

## 🚀 Advanced Usage
